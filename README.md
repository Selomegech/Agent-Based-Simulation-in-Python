# Agent-Based-Simulation-in-Python -  User Purchase Behavior Simulation

## Project Objectives and Scope

### Primary Objective
The primary objective of this mini-project is to design, implement, and analyze a simulation model of user interaction with a software system, specifically focusing on purchase behavior based on demographic data, utilizing the principles of agent-based modeling.

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Gender and Purchase Probability**: Explore the relationship between user gender and purchase probability within the simulated environment.
2. **Mesa Framework Application**: Demonstrate the practical application of the Mesa framework for building agent-based simulations in Python.
3. **Verification and Validation**: Implement verification and validation procedures to assess the accuracy and reliability of the simulation model.
4. **Behavioral Analysis**: Analyze the resulting distribution of purchase probabilities among simulated users to gain insights into behavioral patterns.

### Scope
This project is focused on modeling individual user purchase decisions as discrete events. The primary demographic factor influencing purchase probability will be gender. Other factors, such as specific product interests, social interactions, or external economic influences, are outside the scope of this initial model.

The simulation will operate over a defined number of discrete time steps, representing a series of potential purchase opportunities.
